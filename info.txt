📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Basics Project
Welcome to the EDA Basics project!
This project covers foundational concepts, techniques, and visualizations used in Exploratory Data Analysis using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy.

🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates:

Cleaning and preparing data

Identifying and removing duplicates

Handling missing values

Detecting and treating outliers using IQR and Z-Score

Visualizing data distributions

Creating various types of plots (scatter, boxplot, barplot, line plot, heatmap, etc.)

Understanding feature relationships

Drawing useful insights from datasets

📂 Datasets Used
Superstore Sales data

House Prices data

Tips dataset (Seaborn library)

Titanic dataset

Iris dataset

Diamonds dataset

Heights dataset

Avocado dataset

NHANES health dataset

IMDB 1000 dataset

MTCars dataset

(All datasets are available here)

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

SciPy

pandas_datareader

yfinance (recommended for financial data fetching)

📈 Major Topics Covered
Deleting rows and columns from a DataFrame

Finding and dropping duplicate values

Outlier detection using:

Interquartile Range (IQR)

Z-Score

Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis

Distribution Plots

Subplots and multiple charts

Countplots and Bar plots

Heatmaps for correlation matrices

Line Plots for stock price data

Scatter Plots

Joint Distribution Plots

Parallel Coordinates Plotting

Choosing the right chart for data visualization

📑 Installation
Clone this repository or download the files.

Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scipy yfinance
(Optional) Install pandas_datareader if you want to work with it (but yfinance is recommended):

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas_datareader
